# Counter Addon Patch Notes

# Counter v1.1.1 Patch Notes

**Release Date:** June 8, 2025  
**Author:** wisdomcheese4

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed Steal Detection
- **Issue:** When stealing items from enemies, the addon was incorrectly capturing the monster name along with the item name (e.g., "Maneating Hornet (Pot of Honey)" instead of just "Pot of Honey")
- **Fix:** Improved pattern matching for steal messages to prioritize items in parentheses and better extract just the item name
- **Impact:** Stolen items now display correctly in the tracking list with only their item names

### Fixed Chat Message Color
- **Issue:** Counter messages in the chat log were displaying in purple instead of the intended orange color
- **Fix:** Corrected the color calculation to use the proper additive color method for FFXI chat system
- **New Color:** RGB(255, 128, 0) - Bright orange
- **Impact:** All Counter chat messages now display in a distinct bright orange color for better visibility

## üîß Technical Details

### Steal Pattern Matching Improvements
- Added priority detection for items in parentheses format: `(Item Name)`
- Improved fallback patterns to avoid capturing monster names
- Better handling of various steal message formats from different game mods

### Color System Update
- Changed from incorrect color code (209) to proper additive calculation
- Formula: `123 + (255 * 256¬≥) + (128 * 256¬≤) + (0 * 256)`
- Ensures consistent bright orange display across all FFXI configurations

## üìù Version Summary
- **Previous Version:** 1.1.0
